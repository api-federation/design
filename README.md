# Overview
This repository contains requirements and design documents for API Federation.

API Federation involves creating systems where API consumers and API producers are not directly connected and do not â€¨need to directly trust each other.

The aim of this group is to create vendor-neutral open specifications that enable API federation across two schemes.  


## Designtime Federation  

Allows federation to a heterogenous collection of API Gateways in a uniform manner to discover and gather API Metadata (data about APIs).   

_Typical Use Case: To create a unified marketplace of APIs running on a heterogenous collection of API Gateways._

## Runtime Federation

Allows federation of end-user context at runtime (during API invocation) from the API consumer to heterogenous collection of API Gateways en route.   

_Typical Use Case: API Mashups involving heterogenous API Gateways._
