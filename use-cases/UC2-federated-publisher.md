Assume a company with different departments who use different API Management solutions (because there was no rule to use a single API Management solution initially or the disparity was the result of a company merger). 
E.g. Department A uses WSO2 API Manager, Department B uses Apigee and Department C uses Kong. 

<b> A Federated Publisher </b>
<p>Now the company wants to unify the API Creation process and have a single place and one way to do this because the different solutions provide different ways of doing this. Most customers prefer the capabilities of a publisher portal or a CLI tool and would like to use such tools to publish the APIs to different gateways. Due to time constraints and variations in price, organizations prefer to continue using their current gateways and do not want to switch to a single API Gateway solution which provides such mechanisms. They only want the publishing capabilities.
